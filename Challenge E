Supply Adjustment Algorithm

------------------------------------------------------------------
Objective: Develop an advanced algorithm in Solidity for dynamic token supply adjustment.
Scope:
Algorithm to autonomously adjust token supply in response to market demand, price changes, and specific triggers.
Efficient in terms of gas usage and execution speed.
Scalability for adapting to future market conditions.
Expanded Scope: Integrate real-world events and macroeconomic indicators into the logic.
Innovative Feature: Incorporate machine learning to refine and optimize supply adjustments over time.
Creative Interpretation: Construct a simulation model to forecast long-term impacts of supply adjustments on the token ecosystem.
Expected Deliverable: A well-documented, efficient algorithm with simulation scenarios, performance analytics, and machine learning integration plan.
