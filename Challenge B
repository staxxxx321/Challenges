Objective: Create a Solidity contract with advanced token minting and burning capabilities.
Key Features:
Configurable minting parameters for various conditions.
Automated/manual burning mechanisms to regulate supply.
Transparent event logging for accountability.
Expanded Scope: Introduce tiered minting based on user behavior or network achievements.
Innovative Feature: AI-driven decision-making for token supply management.
Creative Interpretation: Propose unique scenarios for minting/burning utility.
Expected Deliverable: An optimized Solidity smart contract with a comprehensive testing suite.
